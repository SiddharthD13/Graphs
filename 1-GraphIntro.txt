Vertices-> nodes
edges->connecting lines

adjacent nodes -  the nodes directly connected to the node using an edge
types of graphs
1-Undirected graphs - these are bidirectional
2-Directed graphs - these are unidirectional; 

3-Connected graphs - if there is a path between one vertex of a graph to any other vertex , the graph is connected 
4- Disconnected graphs - When there is no edge linking the vertices, you refer to the null graph as a disconnected graph.

connected components:- sub-graphs of a disconnected graph which are connected 

5-Cyclic Graph-If a graph contains at least one graph cycle, it is considered to be cyclic.
6-Acyclic Graph- When there are no cycles in a graph, it is called an acyclic graph.

7-Directed Acyclic Graph-It's also known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it's a graph with directed edges but no cycle. It represents the edges using an ordered pair of vertices since it directs the vertices and stores some data.

8-NUll Graph- verticves with no edges is a a null graph.
9-Trivial Graph- A graph with a single vertice and no edge.

for n vertices there are minimum n-1 edges in a graph
for max no of edges in a graph , each vertex has n-1 edges also o(n^2) number of edges are required in total.Such type of graph is called a complete graph or full graph

Degree:- The no of edges connecting it 

directed graphs types, 
1)indegree-  the number of edges which are coming into the vertex .
2)Outdegree- Outdegree of vertex V is the number of edges which are going out from the vertex V.

Tree is a Undirected unidirectional graph !


types of graph traversals:-

1) Breadth First Traversal:- similar to a level order traversal 
2) Depth First Traversal :- similar to preorder  traversal
